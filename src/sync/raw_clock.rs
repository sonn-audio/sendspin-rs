/// A monotonic time source for clock synchronization.
///
/// Implementations must return microseconds from a stable, monotonic source
/// that is **not** conditioned by NTP rate adjustments (slewing). On Linux,
/// this means `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW` rather than `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`.
///
/// # Why not `std::time::Instant`?
///
/// Rust's `Instant` uses `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` on Linux, which is subject to NTP
/// frequency discipline. When NTP adjusts the tick rate to synchronize with
/// upstream sources, `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` speeds up or slows down slightly. At
/// audio-sync precision (~1ms), even small slew corrections (a few ms over
/// minutes) can destabilize a Kalman filter that's tracking clock offset and
/// drift between client and server.
///
/// On macOS (`mach_absolute_time`) and Windows (`QueryPerformanceCounter`),
/// `Instant` is already raw/unconditioned, so this distinction only matters
/// on Linux.
